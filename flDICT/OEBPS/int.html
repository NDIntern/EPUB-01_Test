            <p class="nonindent"><a id="page1"></a>F<span class="small-1">OR SOME SIXTY YEARS
                    NOW</span>, French readers of Flaubert&#x2019;s last novel, <em>Bouvard and
                    P&#x00E9;cuchet</em>, have been entertained by browsing through its supplement,
                the <em>Dictionnaire des Id&#x00E9;es Re&#x00E7;ues</em>, to which is sometimes
                added the <em>Catalogue des Id&#x00E9;es Chic</em>. Half a dozen editions of this
                appended matter have come out in France, and for the first time as a separate work
                in 1951.<a class="hlink" href="#ftn1" id="ftn1a"><sup>1</sup></a> The Dictionary is
                of course known by reputation in England and America, better known perhaps than
                    <em>Bouvard</em> itself; but despite some fragments rather carelessly translated
                in the magazine <em>Gentry</em> (Summer 1952), the little work cannot be said to
                have entered our literature as have Flaubert&#x2019;s letters and novels.</p>
            <p class="indent">It is not surprising, therefore, that the character of the Dictionary
                is frequently misunderstood, for it cannot be guessed at from mere description or
                random quotation. Indeed, the use and effect of the substance he has left us were
                probably not entirely clear to Flaubert himself. The Dictionary and the dialogue of
                    <em>Bouvard</em> show many parallels, and Flaubert may have intended that after
                his two disappointed heroes have given up active endeavors and started
                &#x201C;copying&#x201D; again they should in <a id="page2"></a>factcollect and copy
                the materials of the Dictionary, together with the quotations of the so-called Album
                or anthology of absurdities. Both works exhibit specimens of the same conventional
                stupidity. But the alphabetful of definitions we have here is compiled from a mass
                of notes, duplicates and variants that were never even sorted, much less
                proportioned and polished by the author. We therefore do him an injustice in calling
                these flying sheets a &#x201C;work&#x201D;. More than one of them would very likely
                have been discarded as his intention grew clearer in the task of revision.</p>
            <p class="indent">What is perfectly clear is Flaubert&#x2019;s attitude towards the
                objects of his satire. We know his state of mind from <em>Bouvard</em>, from the
                letters, from innumerable anecdotes. Travelling by train during the time he was
                composing the novel, he was accosted by a stranger: &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you come
                from So-and-so and aren&#x2019;t you a traveller in oil?&#x201D; &#x201C;No,&#x201D;
                said Flaubert, &#x201C;in vinegar.&#x201D; From infancy, we are told, he refused to
                suffer fools gladly; he would note down the inanities uttered by an old lady who
                used to visit his parents, and by his twentieth year he already had in mind making a
                dictionary of such remarks. And of course, like nearly every French artist since the
                Romantic period, he loathed the bourgeois, whom he once for all defined as &#x201C;a
                being whose mode of feeling is low&#x201D;. From the early 1850&#x2019;s, Flaubert
                kept writing and talking to his friends about this handbook, this Dictionary, as his
                beloved work, his great contribution to moral realism. The project was for him
                charged with a personal emotion, not simply an intellectual one: &#x201C;To
                dissect,&#x201D; he wrote to George Sand, &#x201C;is a form of revenge.&#x201D;</p>
            <p class="indent">Before its adaptation to the requirements of <em>Bouvard</em>, the
                separate Dictionary was to mystify as well as goad the ox: &#x201C;Such a book, with
                a good preface in which the motive would <a id="page3"></a>be stated to be the
                desire to bring the nation back to Tradition, Order and Sound Conventions&#x2014;all
                this so phrased that the reader would not know whether or not his leg was being
                pulled&#x2014;such a book would certainly be unusual, even likely to succeed,
                because it would be entirely up to the minute&#x201D; (to Bouilhet, 4th September
                1850). The same animus against the philistine public, which hardly lets up for an
                instant throughout Flaubert&#x2019;s letters, was to find overt expression in the
                Dictionary, and with impunity: &#x201C;No law could attack me, though I should
                attack everything. It would be the justification of Whatever is is right. I should
                sacrifice the great men to all the nitwits, the martyrs to all the executioners, and
                do it in a style carried to the wildest pitch&#x2014;fireworks&#x2026; After reading
                the book, one would be afraid to talk, for fear of using one of the phrases in
                it&#x201D; (to Louise Colet, 17th December 1852).</p>
            <p class="indent">All this may be called Theme I of the Dictionary: the castigation of
                the clich&#x00E9;. This purpose was not new with Flaubert, though it arose in him
                from native impulse. The captions of Daumier&#x2019;s drawings, the sayings of M.
                Joseph Prudhomme in Henri Monnier&#x2019;s fictional <em>Memoirs</em> of that
                character (1857), as well as a number of other less enduring works, testify to the
                nineteenth century&#x2019;s growing awareness of mass production in word and
                thought. In the one year 1879, two contemporaries of Flaubert&#x2019;s, the
                celebrated horn player and wit Eug&#x00E8;ne Vivier and the obscure L&#x2019;Epine,
                both published brochures having the same tendency as the projected Dictionary.
                Flaubert read them at once and was relieved: &#x201C;Nothing to
                fear&#x2014;asinine.&#x201D; In spite of this summary dismissal, Vivier&#x2019;s
                    <em>Un peu de ce qui se dit tous les jours</em> was quite superior to
                L&#x2019;Epine&#x2019;s <em>Parfait Causeur</em> and it certainly anticipated the
                tone of the Flaubertian clich&#x00E9;: &#x201C;They quarrel all day long, but really
                adore <a id="page4"></a>each other.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;With me, it&#x2019;s just
                the opposite: if I didn&#x2019;t drink any, I wouldn&#x2019;t sleep all night.<a
                    class="hlink" href="#ftn2" id="ftn2a"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
            <p class="indent">The clich&#x00E9;, as its name indicates, is the metal plate that
                clicks and reproduces the same image mechanically without end. This is what
                distinguishes it from an idiom or a proverb. <em>The Dictionary of
                    Clich&#x00E9;s</em> published some years ago by Mr. Eric Partridge straddles
                several species of set phrases and hence bears no likeness to Flaubert&#x2019;s: it
                makes no point. The true nature of the thing Flaubert was out to capture and
                alphabetize was first discussed by an American in our century and endowed by him
                with a new name which has passed into the language: Gelett Burgess&#x2019;s
                &#x201C;Are you a Bromide?&#x201D; appeared as a magazine article in 1906. In book
                form it lists forty-eight genuine clich&#x00E9;s (including the archetypal:
                &#x201C;It isn&#x2019;t the money, it&#x2019;s the principle of the thing&#x201D;)
                and it makes the fundamental point that &#x201C;it is not merely because this remark
                is trite that it is bromidic; it is because with the Bromide the remark is
                    <em>inevitable</em>.&#x201D;</p>
            <p class="indent">In reading Flaubert&#x2019;s Dictionary, this principle has to be
                borne in mind, for some of the utterances pilloried are manifestly true; they have
                to be said at certain times, being in themselves neither fatuous nor tautological.
                What damns them is the fact that they are the only thing ever said on the subject by
                the middling sensual man. As in the works of our modern lexicographer&#x2014;Mr.
                Frank Sullivan&#x2019;s Arbuthnot, the clich&#x00E9; expert&#x2014;the form, imagery
                and intention of the remarks are immediately recognized as approved, accepted,
                inescapable, <em>re&#x00E7;ues</em> before they begin. In Flaubert&#x2019;s
                entourage these expressions recurred, more frequent and regular than the tides, and
                drove him frantic. For we should remember that he passed <a id="page5"></a>much of
                his life at Croisset, on the right bank of the Seine below Rouen, and was forced to
                listen there to much conversation that was not simply bourgeois and philistine, but
                invincibly repetitious and provincial. Traces of this aggravation are abundant in
                the Dictionary (e.g. C<span class="small-1">OFFEE</span>, C<span class="small"
                    >OTTON</span>, C<span class="small-1">LOTH</span>), and one may surmise that in
                the finished work these local allusions would have been either eliminated or
                signalized as home variants of cosmic bromidism.</p>
            <p class="indent">At any rate, to Flaubert these repetitions proved more than signs of
                dullness, they were philosophic clues from which he inferred the transformation of
                the human being under machine capitalism. This he took as a personal affront.
                Representing Mind, he fought the encroachment of matter and mechanism into the empty
                places that should have been minds. He kept seeking ways of rendering what he saw,
                and in addition to <em>Bouvard</em> and the Dictionary, he got as far as writing and
                circulating&#x2014;no one would produce it&#x2014;a sort of Expressionist play
                called <em>The Castle of Hearts</em>, of which the effect was to be &#x201C;comic
                and sinister&#x201D;. The chief scene would show, through the glass walls of
                identical houses along a Paris street, identical bourgeois families eating identical
                meals and exchanging identical words to identical gestures. This of course is akin
                to the scheme of Zola&#x2019;s <em>Pot-Bouille</em> (<em>Restless House</em>) and
                many another attempt at literary Unanimism since: the device was in the air with the
                hum of machinery.</p>
            <p class="indent">But while giving the nineteenth century its share in the formation of
                the bourgeois and bromide, one must not overlook a second influence at work in
                shaping Flaubert&#x2019;s material. The Dictionary frequently derides the specially
                French as against the European or world outlook; the stay-at-home timidity and love
                of the familiar which, although a universal trait, is reinforced <a id="page6"
                ></a>in France by a tradition of complacency that dates back to Louis XIV. This is
                what Flaubert had in mind when he spoke of his work bringing back the nation to
                Tradition, Order and Sound Conventions. (See the comment upon the architectural
                orders and all the references to the causes of the Revolution.) The reception of
                    <em>Salammb&#x00F4;</em> by the Paris critics, and particularly by Sainte-Beuve,
                illustrated for him the same self-centerdness.</p>
            <p class="indent">To this one must add that the French language, despite its marvellous
                power of combining force and subtlety, is traditionally a language of
                clich&#x00E9;s. Readymade expressions abound and are to be preferred; indeed it is
                not licit to break them up, it is &#x201C;extravagant&#x201D;. The
                seventeenth-century aesthetician P&#x00E8;re Bouhours has an anecdote on this point
                which has become famous&#x2014;almost a clich&#x00E9;: a piece of writing having
                been shown to an &#x201C;illustrious personage&#x201D;, this arbiter of taste smiled
                and said: &#x201C;These words must be greatly astonished to find themselves
                together, for assuredly they had never met before.&#x201D;</p>
            <p class="indent">It is but a few steps from this to Flaubert&#x2019;s &#x201C;always
                preceded (or followed) by&#x201D; and his other set devices. They all indicate a
                fixity, which on reflection is seen to go beyond forms of speech or lack of ideas or
                aimless parroting. Social in origin, it is lust for order through convention. Take,
                for example, Flaubert&#x2019;s great negative: &#x201C;Thunder against&#x201D;
                    (<em>tonner contre</em>). The injunction succinctly represents the agreed-upon
                necessity to defend the family, property, religion&#x2014;the famous
                &#x201C;bases&#x201D; of society&#x2014;against attack. Nor is this a French trait
                exclusively. One thinks at once of Trollope&#x2019;s <em>Jupiter</em> and
                    <em>Thunderer</em> newspapers thundering on the same subjects and of Mr. Podsnap
                leaning on his mantelpiece while he lectures about the British constitution to (it
                so happens) a Frenchman. Almost every social critic of the <a id="page7"
                ></a>nineteenth century was persuaded that more light shone beyond the frontier, and
                Dickens and Flaubert are at one about the ubiquitous Podsnap underfoot.</p>
            <p class="indent">The affirmative counterpart of &#x201C;Thunder against&#x201D; is
                &#x201C;Very swank&#x201D; (<em>tr&#x00E8;s chic</em> or <em>bien
                port&#x00E9;</em>). This designates words and acts which deviate from the norm
                without undermining the &#x201C;bases&#x201D;; here is variety which will not bring
                on revolution. For revolution is the bugbear behind much of the thundering, and no
                reader of history can question the reality of the threat. In English-speaking
                countries one tends to imagine that the Continent was then freer in mind than
                England, precisely because it indulged in frequent uprisings. Flaubert&#x2019;s
                Dictionary should suffice to show that France had its Victorianism too. The
                connection between sexual and political conformity is well-known, and sexual
                matters, it is clear, occupy in Flaubert&#x2019;s definitions a place that would be
                disproportionate if it were not so unmistakably a cultural sign. Some of the items
                under this head sound fantastic to us, others quite up-to-date. Other entries, which
                are free from either sex or politics, remind us that democratic jealousy and
                competition were already strong and therefore repressed, therefore guilty and
                aggressive in the small ways we know so well&#x2014;for example, giving your
                neighbor the benefit of your superior knowledge: &#x201C;The only good X comes from
                Y.&#x201D;</p>
            <p class="indent">To the extent that some of the remarks &#x201C;date,&#x201D; the
                Dictionary is an admirable document. A good many sayings are inspired by the
                Franco-Prussian war which, as we know from Gobineau&#x2019;s searching essay on the
                d&#x00E9;b&#x00E2;cle, let loose an unprecedented amount of nonsense. In such
                circumstances the clich&#x00E9; becomes a shield against hard truth, humiliation and
                despair. And that is the moment seized by the satirist to avenge <a id="page8"
                ></a>himself, like a reborn Cassandra, by dissecting the present: &#x201C;All our
                trouble,&#x201D; writes Flaubert to George Sand in the wretched year 1871,
                &#x201C;comes from our gigantic ignorance&#x2026; When shall we get over empty
                speculation and accepted ideas? What should be studied is believed without
                discussion. Instead of examining, people pontificate.&#x201D;</p>
            <p class="indent">In so saying, Flaubert states Theme 2 of the Dictionary&#x2014;the
                attack on misinformation, prejudice and incoherence as regards matters of fact.
                Flaubert has an infallible ear for the contradictions that everybody absent-mindedly
                repeats: &#x201C;A<span class="small-1">BSINTHE</span>&#x2014;Violent poison: one
                glass and you&#x2019;re dead. Newspapermen drink it as they write their
                copy.&#x201D; He plumbs with equal sureness the depths of well-bred
                ignorance&#x2014;or rather his eye takes in at a glance the shoals of common
                knowledge: people know only two things about Archimedes, not three. Here too, in
                culture, art, history, science and social thought, some things are to be thundered
                against, others are very swank. The bourgeois mind in this department of life is a
                compound of error, pedantry, misplaced scorn, fatuous levity and ignorance of its
                ignorance.</p>
            <p class="indent">As before in language, so again in opinion, the French tradition works
                towards a conventional narrowing. French textbooks repeat the same views, offer the
                same extracts and, lest the student should rashly venture on a perception of his
                own, guide him with footnotes to the correct criticism of the text: the child reads
                and repeats apropos of a verse or a turn of phrase: &#x201C;<em>m&#x00E9;taphore
                    hardie</em>,&#x201D; &#x201C;<em>pl&#x00E9;onasme vicieux</em>,&#x201D; and the
                like. In working at <em>Bouvard</em> Flaubert consulted&#x2014;or had helpers
                abstract for him&#x2014;over a thousand works of reference or instruction, from
                which he culled the enormities that enliven the pages of that novel and that were
                also to fill out its documentary <a id="page9"></a>sequel. The Dictionary appears as
                a vestibule between two storerooms.</p>
            <p class="indent">But the systematic hunt for howlers became dangerous to the hunter and
                to his plan. It is not simply that the two clerks, whose lives were first to be
                chronicled as <em>Memoirs of Two Cockroaches</em>, turned into subtle and ingenious
                spokesmen for their creator (e.g. Chapters IV and V on literature and history) but
                that Flaubert himself became something of a pedant. In the Dictionary he grows
                schoolmarmish over common expressions that are justifiable and useful, such as that
                which marks the contrast between warmed air in a sheltered spot and the open air
                which is cooler. (See A<span class="small-1">IR</span> and also A<span class="small"
                    >CCIDENT</span>, E<span class="small-1">ARTH</span>, L<span class="small"
                    >ILAC</span>.) Elsewhere he shows off minute knowledge acquired in tracking down
                gross errors; he grows ungenerous (W<span class="small-1">RITE</span>); and in
                recording the many superstitions about health and hygiene, he surely confuses old
                peasant notions with the more reprehensible (because &#x201C;educated&#x201D;)
                prejudices that have replaced the first.</p>
            <p class="indent">He was fully aware of his danger: &#x201C;The book I am working on
                could have as sub-title, Encyclopaedia of Human Stupidity. The undertaking gets me
                down and my subject becomes part of me&#x2026;&#x201D; To this immersion we may
                perhaps attribute a slip he would certainly have ridiculed in another writer:
                    &#x201C;S<span class="small-1">CAFFOLD</span>&#x2014;When upon it, manage to say a
                few eloquent words <em>before dying</em>.&#x201D; I underscore the words rather than
                Flaubert&#x2019;s carelessness, for he was ready to make fun of himself under the
                same rubric as the bourgeois. The comment on F<span class="small-1">ULMINATE</span> (a
                favorite verb of his) is surely directed at himself, and we know from a note in the
                Catalogue that he planned to include among its blunders a sentence from <em>Madame
                    Bovary</em>.</p>
            <p class="indent">In collecting spoken and printed nonsense Flaubert had even more
                predecessors than in recording clich&#x00E9;s. The <em>sottisier</em> is an <a
                    id="page10"></a>old French genre, which in our day is represented by
                Curnonsky&#x2019;s <em>Le Mus&#x00E9;e des Erreurs</em> and George Jean
                Nathan&#x2019;s <em>Great American Credo</em>, as well as <em>The New
                    Yorker&#x2019;s</em> vigilant scanning of the daily press. But since Flaubert
                did not live to write the preface to his Dictionary, the analysis of Theme 2 is
                lacking. For a clue comparable to Gelett Burgess&#x2019;s one must go to a chapter
                in George Campbell&#x2019;s <em>Philosophy of Rhetoric</em>: &#x201C;Why is it
                Nonsense so often escapes both reader and writer?&#x201D; The answer is: we think by
                signs, and the connectedness they have acquired as signs makes us believe in the
                connection of the things they stand for. Thus in the Dictionary: &#x201C;A<span
                    class="small">NTICHRIST</span>&#x2014;Voltaire, Renan&#x2026;&#x201D; or
                    &#x201C;L<span class="small-1">YNX</span>&#x2014;Animal famous for its
                eye.&#x201D;</p>
            <p class="indent">Nascent specialization in Flaubert&#x2019;s day obviously encouraged
                the sin of affirming without examining and he found brilliant ways of showing this.
                One is the recurrent &#x201C;Meaning unknown&#x201D; (<em>on ne sait pas ce que
                    c&#x2019;est</em>), with its variant: &#x201C;Nobody is expected to
                know.&#x201D; The other is a device that deserves to be called
                    <em>Flaubertismus</em>. It consists in plucking out of all possible usages the
                two unrelated ones that are truly common and exclusive, thus &#x201C;G<span
                    class="small">ROUP</span>&#x2014;Suitable for a mantelpiece and in
                politics.&#x201D; (See also P<span class="small-1">ROSPECTS</span> and U<span
                    class="small">NLEASH</span>.)</p>
            <p class="indent">But like stupidity and pedantry, specialization is catching. Stendhal
                had pointed out long before Flaubert that &#x201C;an idiot who knows a date can
                disconcert the wittiest man&#x201D; At times Flaubert did not quite know with whom
                to side, the wit or the man with a date. He seems to be, as we say in our jargon, a
                realist. He derides angels, wings, poetry and lakes&#x2014;which looks like throwing
                Romanticism to the dogs. But he is full of Romanticism and will not let it be
                wantonly attacked by anybody but himself. By reverse sarcasm he defends dreamers,
                poets, ideals, great men against fools, and martyrs against <a id="page11"
                ></a>realists. In the end he does not take sides but knows what he thinks. About
                literature, politics and religion he quotes the current cant of both parties and
                berates it with bad puns, double entendres and forgotten jokes. What he steadily
                denounces, then, is not the bourgeois as such&#x2014;since the poor creature cannot
                please him by saying either white or black&#x2014;but the bourgeois
                &#x201C;style&#x201D; in the Nietzschean sense, that is to say, lack of style. The
                bourgeois as an historic phenomenon and a live obnoxious neighbor is lost in a
                frontal assault on what has been the enemy all along&#x2014;lack of passion and
                imagination.</p>
            <p class="indent">Though all these are large targets and strong hatreds, their presence
                is conveyed for the most part by irony and innuendo and in the most laconic French
                imaginable. The task of the translator can thence be inferred as more than usually
                arduous. To give anything like the impression of the original, he must be just as
                natural and fully as quick. Yet he must jump the language barrier from clich&#x00E9;
                to clich&#x00E9; while carrying from one culture and background to their
                counterparts what &#x201C;everybody knows&#x201D;&#x2014;or doesn&#x2019;t know. He
                is continually beset by dilemmas, tempted by lesser advantages, threatened by
                ambiguities. Whether to take the obvious but factually different equivalent; whether
                to make clear what the English requires if any meaning is to emerge, even though the
                French is content with a vagueness that is wholly intelligible; whether to say
                &#x201C;you&#x201D; for &#x201C;<em>on</em>&#x201D;&#x2014;the pronoun which
                Flaubert would have had to invent had it not already existed: <em>on dit, on ne sait
                    pas</em>; whether to render identical expressions identically throughout, at the
                cost of one misfit out of three; whether to omit or re-invent&#x2014;these and a
                multitude of other questions arise at every turn, sometimes two or three abreast in
                one definition.</p>
            <p class="indent"><a id="page12"></a>I shall not argue here for the points of method I
                have followed,<a class="hlink" href="#ftn3" id="ftn3a"><sup>3</sup></a> but simply
                list some of the compromises I have made, mentioning at the same time that the notes
                marked &#x201C;Fr&#x201D; give the significant French word wherever a wide leap of
                denotation was taken for the sake of indispensable immediacy of understanding. I
                have used quotation marks much more freely than Flaubert, to stress the thing said
                as against the mere belief; I have used analogies from English and American life,
                tags from English and American authors, just like changes in denotation, for
                immediacy; I have felt similarly free in mixing tones, using our century&#x2019;s
                colloquialisms side by side with such expressions as &#x201C;Thunder against&#x201D;
                and &#x201C;Wax indignant,&#x201D; which I felt were Flaubert&#x2019;s just levy on
                his contemporaries&#x2019; idiom.</p>
            <p class="indent">Finally, I have combined certain entries under one head, for
                convenience, or perforce when there was but one English word for two French synonyms
                that Flaubert had treated separately (F<span class="small-1">EU</span>, I<span
                    class="small">NCENDIE</span>). The twenty-one items of the <em>Catalogue des
                    Id&#x00E9;es Chic</em> were left out as being too fragmentary and often too
                parochial. The notes upon it would have taken more room than the list itself, and
                the impression of so much semi-recondite matter would have spoiled whatever unity of
                effect had been achieved in rendering the Dictionary. It also, one cannot too
                frequently repeat, is but a mass of notes out of a folder. Would that all our
                scattered papers held half so insidious an appeal to later minds!</p>
