                School habits are bad habits. Given the right habits one could play the violin like

            <p class="hanging">H<span class="small-1">AMMOCK</span>. Characteristic of creole women.
                Indispensable in a garden. Persuade yourself that it is more comfortable than a

            <p class="hanging">H<span class="small-1">ASHEESH</span>. Do not confuse with hash, which

                Egyptians, invented by the priests to conceal their shameful secrets. &#x201C;Just

                may be a hoax&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>
            <p class="hanging">H<span class="small-1">IPPOCRATES</span>. Always to be cited in Latin

            <p class="hanging">H<span class="small-1">IPPOLYTUS</span>. His death the most beautiful
                narrative subject that can be assigned in class. Everyone should know the piece by
                    heart.<a class="hlink" href="#ftn8-6" id="ftn8-6a"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
            <p class="hanging">H<span class="small-1">OME</span>. Always a castle inviolate. However,

                &#x201C;But he that filches from me my good name doth make me poor indeed.&#x201D;
                One must always be concerned about one&#x2019;s own, and not greatly concerned about

            <p class="hanging">H<span class="small-1">ORSES</span>. If they knew their strength, they
                would not let themselves be led. Horsemeat: excellent subject for a pamphlet by a
                man seeking a reputation. Racehorse: despise it&#x2014;of what use is it?</p>
            <p class="hanging">H<span class="small-1">OSPITALITY</span>. Must always be Scottish.
                Quote: &#x201C;In Scotland, hospitality when sought is given and never
                bought.&#x201D;</p>
            <p class="hanging">H<span class="small-1">OSPODAR</span>. Sounds well in a remark on the
                Near East question.</p>
            <p class="hanging">H<span class="small-1">OSTILITIES</span>. Hostilities are like oysters,
                they have to be opened, &#x201C;Open hostilities&#x201D; sounds as if one ought to
                sit down at table.</p>

            <p class="hanging">H<span class="small-1">UNT</span>. Good exercise, which one must
                pretend to love. Part of the royal state. The judiciary rave about it.</p>
            <p class="hanging">H<span class="small-1">USSAR</span>. Pronounce hoozar. Always preceded
                by &#x201C;handsome&#x201D; or &#x201C;dashing&#x201D;. Attracts the ladies. Never
                fail to hum: &#x201C;You who know a young hussar&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>
