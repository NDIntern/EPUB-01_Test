                    Though Sainte-Beuve was reconciled to the Empire and well-treated by authority,
                    he was thought to be a malicious freethinker. A dinner given by him on 10th
                    April 1868 (Good Friday) gave rise to rumours that &#x201C;an orgy&#x201D; had
                    taken place. The guests included Flaubert, Taine, and Renan.</p>

                    is in fact the name of a man and of his sister, both writers. Georges de
                    Scud&#x00E9;ry (1601&#x2013;1667) was a prolific playwright in verse whom
                    Boileau ridiculed for his bombast. Scud&#x00E9;ry&#x2019;s sister Madeleine
                    (1607&#x2013;1701) was one of the <em>pr&#x00E9;cieuses</em>. She produced the
                    chief ten-volume novels of the period and was still writing verses at the age of
                    ninety-two. Scud&#x00E9;ry&#x2019;s wife is also known for her letters, which
                    have been published, but she was not a professional writer.</p>

                    Well-known hero of novels and plays by Henri Monnier (1805&#x2013;1877). Joseph
                    Prudhomme is a kind of French Podsnap. full of philistine feeling and absurd
                    sentiments. (See Introduction.)</p>

                        &#x201C;<em>D&#x00E9;rat&#x00E9;</em>&#x201D; is an established word which
                    means &#x201C;having had the spleen removed&#x201D; and which implies
                    light-heartedness. freedom from care. By extension comes the idea that such a
                    penon can run faster than others. Flaubert has another entry under this
                    untranslatable word; &#x201C;No need to be aware that the removal of the spleen
                    has never been attempted on man.&#x201D;</p>
