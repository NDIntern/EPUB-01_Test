            <p class="nonindent">When New Directions decided to publish an English version of
                    <em>Bouvard et P&#x00E9;cuchet</em> in 1954, Mr. James Laughlin asked me to
                complete the translation of the <em>Dictionnaire des Id&#x00E9;es
                Re&#x00E7;ues</em>, which he knew I had been toying with for some years. I did so,
                and the translation appeared both with the novel and separately for the first time
                in the United States.</p>
            <p class="indent">After its appearance I kept revising my text, in hopes of a second
                edition. That opportunity came when Max Reinhardt of London brought out under the
                same title a much improved text. I was still unsatisfied and kept fiddling (as well
                as correcting mistakes of interpretation in the notes), so as to be ready for a
                third chance, meanwhile circulating a longish errata list privately among
                friends.</p>
            <p class="indent">A renewed demand for the little work made itself known to New
                Directions about 1966 and plans made for another edition, entirely reset. I pulled
                out my interlined copy once more and made further changes, which Mr. Laughlin gave
                me yet one more opportunity to add to in proofs. I am sorry to let my author go, but
                I think I have done all I could. There, in the words of Byron, let him
                <em>lay</em>.</p>
