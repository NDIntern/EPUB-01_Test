                Thunder against the Chamber of Deputies. &#x201C;Too many talkers there, they never

            <p class="hanging">R<span class="small-1">ESTAURANT</span>. You should order the dishes
                not usually served at home. When uncertain, look at what others around you are
                eating.</p>
            <p class="hanging">R<span class="small-1">EUNION</span>. &#x201C;A good time was had by
                all. Most of us will never forget it.&#x201D; It never breaks up without plans being
                laid for the one next year. The life of the party must not fail to say: &#x201C;All,

                your fingers misshapen.</p>
            <p class="hanging">R<span class="small-1">ONSARD</span>. Absurd, with his Greek and Latin
                words.</p>
